# Booli Token (BOOLI)

The BOOLI token is the native currency of the Booli blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## BOOLI utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Booli blockchain, BOOLI is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Booli to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 5K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.booliscan.com/](https://status.booliscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked BOOLI. Which means validators with higher amounts of Booli staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any BOOLI holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of BOOLI they wish. They receive a share of the Booli block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As BOOLI is the native currency on Booli, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, BOOLI transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of BOOLI tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Booli platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
